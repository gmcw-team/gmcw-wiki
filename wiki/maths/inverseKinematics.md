# Inverse Kinematics
Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a way of solving the orientations of joints such that an appendage gets as close as possible to some target position.

This is useful in video games for proceedural animation and allowing your actors to interact dynamically with the game world.

## Examples
Examples of IK used in GameMaker
* [IK Scripts](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/6157/inverse-kinematics)/[tutorial](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/6279/inverse-kinematics-tutorial) - An extension that provides resizable arms which are solved using FABRIK IK
* [Skeletal Animation](https://github.com/NuxiiGit/gms2d-skeletal-animation) - A collection of scripts for building and rendering bone animations
