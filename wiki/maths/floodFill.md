# Flood Fill
A flood fill is an algorithm that can be used to traverse every pixel or node in a contiguous area. The most common use for it is a paint-bucket tool in a painting program, but it can also be used as a way to search all squares in a grid.

There are two main approaches: Recursive, and Stack/queue-based. It is generally accepted that the recursive flood-fill, while simple, in practice runs the risk of hitting recursion limits or [stack overflows](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/comments/38uw9o/stack_overflow_with_flood_fill_script/). A Stack/queue-based approach is more complex but safer.
