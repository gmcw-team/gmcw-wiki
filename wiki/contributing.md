# Contributing to the GM Community Wiki
The GameMaker Community Wiki is a community-run wiki containing documentation, code snippets, and tutorials. It is maintained by you, the GameMaker user community.

Anyone can contribute, and help build on this collection of knowledge for the benefit of all GameMaker users.

## How to Contribute
Contribution is done using GitHub. The GMCW wiki pages are stored as [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files in a github repository. You can contribute by merging your additions/edits into the repository.

To contirbute, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, a git client, and a reasonably good understanding of how git and GitHub works.

### Step 0: Find the repository
Click on the "Edit on Github" button in the bottom right of this page. This will take you to the git repository where this wiki's files are hosted.

### Step 1: Fork the repository
Unless you are a maintainer, you will have to make a copy of the repository to add content to it. Click "Fork" in the top right corner of the github repository to make a fork of this repo into your own account.

### Step 2: Clone your fork to your computer

### Step 4: Commit and push your changes
Commit and push your changes to your fork on GitHub using your git client of choice.

### Step 5: Make a PR
Make a Pull Request from your fork back to the main repository. Please outline the changes you have made in the Pull Request decription. Your contribution will be moderated by one of the GM Community Wiki maintainers.

Please be patient, maintainers are all volunteers, and it is not their sole job to maintain and review PRs.
